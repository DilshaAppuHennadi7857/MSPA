b) The code is obtaining TE_10 and TM_10 in both the x and y directions - i.e. the x and y components
of the fundamental mode for the transverse electric and magnetic waves through a 3-layer ridge
waveguide. These are found using the finite difference method to obtain the eigenmodes.

b) At smaller half-widths the N_eff is lower compared to the N_eff at larger half-widths. As N_eff is
the effective refractive index of the material, it describes the relative phase delay per unit length
in the material compared to the phase delay of a vacuum. Since we see N_eff decrease with narrower
half-widths, then the relative phase delay cause by the material seems to decrease with narrower
half-widths.

c) By making the grid less denes- i.e. increasing dx and dy by a factor of 8 - the surface plots become
less smooth and continuous as they were before. Additionally, the plot of N_eff is more jagged with a
few areas where it seems as though N_eff is constant within a range of half-widths. However, from
observations of the original meshgrid, we know that N_eff does in fact vary in those regions. Thus, it
is important when running such simulations that we're aware of our grid size and try to use as fine a
meshgrid as we can.

b) As the index of the ridge drops, we see a drop in N_eff - which is to be expected. The effect of
the varying N_eff can be seen in the changes to the fundamental mode with each different refractive
index.
